# BAM - Balyasny Asset Management
Bam(Balyasny Asset Management) code challenge

Here's a breakdown of what the application does:

Imports: The script imports various Python libraries necessary for data analysis and visualization, including Bokeh, Pandas, NumPy, Holoviews, and Matplotlib.

Data Loading: The script loads data from a CSV file named 'signals-2018-09-20.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame (dfst). The CSV file likely contains historical data related to signals and trading positions for different stocks or tickers.

Visualization Setup: The script sets up Bokeh plots for visualizing signal analysis, trading positions, and cumulative total relative return. It defines several Bokeh figures (plot, plot_position, plot_stlr) with specific attributes such as plot dimensions, titles, axes, and tools for zooming and saving.

Interactive Widgets: The script creates interactive widgets using Bokeh, including a dropdown menu (options) for selecting different tickers, date pickers (date_from and date_to) for choosing date ranges.

Data Processing: The script defines a function select_sessions() that processes the selected ticker and date range to filter and manipulate the data accordingly. It calculates exponential moving averages (EMA), trading positions, and strategy total returns based on the selected data.

Data Update and Visualization: The script defines an update() function that updates the data displayed on the Bokeh plots based on user interactions with the widgets. It updates the data source (source) used by the plots with the filtered and processed data.

Layout and Presentation: The script defines a layout structure using Bokeh's layout features, including rows and columns to organize the plots and widgets. It also includes a title banner (div1) at the top of the dashboard.

Dashboard Deployment: The script adds the layout to the Bokeh document (curdoc()) and sets the title of the document to "BAM Analytics Application".

In summary, the application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring historical signals, trading positions, and cumulative returns for different stocks or tickers within Balyasny Asset Management's analytics framework. Users can interactively select tickers and date ranges to visualize and analyze the data through the provided plots and widgets.
